### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--

I am currently working on multiple exciting projects ranging from a Blog Web Application using Flask, HTML, CSS and SQL; 
a Python project that detects drowsiness and takes measures to alert the user of the state utilizing Machine Learning; a
Python project that uses the Bellman-Ford algorithm to detect arbitrage opportunities to trade and generate profit.

If you find them inciteful or fatally wrong, reach out to me at onyandoroy@gmail.com. 

Fun Fact: Someday, it will excite more than me!
